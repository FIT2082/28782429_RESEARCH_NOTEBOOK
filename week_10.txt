Jackson has resolved the depth inconsistency issue by implementing a depth mapping function in the machine learning models. The result of this is that the models are producing results which perform significantly better than the SCIP solver method. This is extremely good news. We now just have to test the models on more test cases, for more accurate results. I have created a draft for the introduction and aim sections of the poster, and will ask Pierre and Eddy for feedback next week.
