Now we have a base set of simple data along with a simple machine learning algorithm, we can now expand and develop them. This will include gathering information about the depth of each node when branching, and reformatting the data extraction format to be more dynamic. We are also searching for more complex instances of MIP problems which we can test our algorithm on. However, we must be particular with these test cases, as they often take hours to complete. Additionally, Jackson and I will begin creating a draft for the poster.
