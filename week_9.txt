I found a database of test mixed integer programming problem instances, and have begun extracting data for Jackson. The elements we need in our data extraction including information when the SCIP solver predicts and trains how to branch at each node. One of these elements is the depth of the nodes. Unfortunately, Jackson, when applying the data to the machine learning models, has found an issue in regards to these depths, as the training and predicting depths are not consistent, and the models are not impactful when compared to SCIP. We are currently looking to resolve the depth inconsistencies. Jackson and I have also created a draft poster template.
