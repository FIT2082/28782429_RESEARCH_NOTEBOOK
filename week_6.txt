Jackon and I have decided to split up the tasks: I am working on extracting the pseudo-cost data we need from the SCIP software, Jackson is working to develop some prototype machine learning algorithms. Eddy, a PHD student also working with Pierre gave us some more feedback for the project specification. We made updated the specification and finally submitted it to Pierre for marking.
