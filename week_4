Pierre gave us some formalised information about the problem we are trying to solve, which helped us to write the project specification. Jackon and I also met with Ben, a postgraduate researcher who is also currently working on MIP problems. Ben can help with any future issues that Pierre may be unavailable to help with. I learnt that the SCIP software has its unique memory and parameter allocation system. Pierre also told which file in SCIP we should be editting.
