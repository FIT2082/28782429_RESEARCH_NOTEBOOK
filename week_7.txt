I have extracted some data from the SCIP software, which incudes information about how SCIP makes branching decisions when solving MIP problems. Jackson has created a prototype machine learning algorithm and has begun training it with the data I extracted. I have also extracted some data about how SCIP predicts (gets) pseudocost values, as opposed to how SCIP trains (updates) pseudocost values. However there a few issues in regards to the data we actually need from SCIP, so Jackson and I plan to verify with Pierre in our next meeting.
