I met with Pierre and Jackson, and Pierre gave us a description of the task. The problem involved using machine learning algorithms to better predict optimal routes when traversing a decision tree. The current problem is a component of a much larger problem Pierre has been working on for some time. I have been given a few tasks by Pierre, including setting up and Linux machine, creating a Git respository with Jackson, installing SCIP, and learning C and Make.
